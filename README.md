# Mock-Admin-Dashboard

My take on the Admin Dashboard project, courtesy of The Odin Project. Aside from the color and images, I mainly tried to stay close to the example we were shown to follow. I stil feel like there are some quirks in terms of postioning, but as a whole I feel like I've done a decent job for this project.

A lot of this project involved using CSS Grid to postion elements. I tried my best to keep the page scalable to some extent using Grid properties, but a good chunck of content have fixed pixels to make accurate sizes of shapes. I feel like I could've played around with clamp() or minmax() properties to solve those issues but the CSS was already a lot to handle.

In terms of improvements I would probably like to go back and optimize the CSS as I feel like it got messy towards the end of the project. Some of the spacing could also be improved.
